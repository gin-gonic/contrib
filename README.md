# gin-gonic/contrib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gin-gonic/contrib.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gin-gonic/contrib)
=======
Here you'll find middleware ready to  use with [Gin Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). Submit your pull request, either with the package in a folder, or by adding a link to this `README.md`.

If adding a package directly, don't forget to create a `README.md` inside with author name.
If adding a link to your own repository, please follow this example:

```
+ nameOfMiddleware (https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo)
```

Each author is responsible of maintaining his own code, although if you submit as a package, you allow the community to fix it. You can also submit a pull request to fix an existing package.
